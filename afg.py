# Audio Function Generator; "afg.py"...
# -------------------------------------
#
# A fun Python program to generate a Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth,
# and Pulse waveforms using STANDARD Python at the earphone sockets.
# This is for (PC)Linux(OS), (ONLY?), and was done purely for fun.
# (It has now been tested on Debian 6.0.0 and Knoppix 5.1.1!)
#
# Although it is fairly easy to alter the frequency within limits I
# have left it at approximately 1KHz to keep the code size down...
#
# It would be tricky to change the output level using STANDARD Python
# for (PC)Linux(OS) 2009 using this idea to generate waveforms, but it
# is possible within limits.
#
# (Original idea copyright, (C)2009, B.Walker, G0LCU.)
# Issued as Public Domain, (to LXF) and you may do with it as you please.
#
# It is assumed that /dev/audio exists; if NOT, then install oss-compat
# from the distro`s repository.
#
# Ensure the sound system is not already in use.
#
# Copy the file to the Lib folder(/drawer/directory) or where the modules
# reside as "afg.py"...
#
# For a quick way to run just use at the ">>>" prompt:-
#
# >>> import afg[RETURN/ENTER]
#
# And away we go...
#
# The waveforms generated are unfiltered and therefore not "pure",
# but hey, an audio function generator signal source, for free, without
# external hardware, AND, using standard Python, what more do you want... :)
#
# Using my notebook about 150mV p-p was generated at the earphone
# socket(s).
#
# Coded on a(n) HP dual core notebook running PCLinuxOS 2009 and
# Python 2.5.2 for Linux...
#
# You will need an oscilloscope connected to the earphone socket(s)
# to see the resultant waveform(s) generated, or listen to the
# harshness of the sound... ;o)
#
# It is EASILY possible to generate pseudo-random noise also but
# I'll leave that for you to work out... :)

# Import any modules...
